# <Homework-1>

## Description

This website had a few bugs users reported. I got a ticket to go and find isuues within the HTML and CSS files and make the website more user friendly. This will solve links within the website and make the HTML more semantic so others that look at the code can find it more user friendly. During this fix I learned that having semantics within the file makes it easier to find issues and edit within the files.

## Installation

Once I recieved the on the job ticket I used the git pull command to download the files needed to my computer. While I was working on the site I frequently used git commits and pushes to update the repositry and make sure the website was up to date.

## Usage

This website is the homepage for Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc.
